# Error in overflow and carry flags
We just force C to be selected for logical operations and C to be 0 as well.

S2 will be same.

Only C will be changed.

$$C = \prod(3,5,6,7)$$

Which was obtained from a modified kmap.That's it.

Also this means we can just use So and D3 for implementation of C.

$$C = S_\text{0} \cdot D_\text{3}$$
