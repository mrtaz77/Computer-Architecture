# Error in overflow and carry flags
We just force P to be selected for logical operations and P to be 0 as well.

S2 will be same.

Only P will be changed.

$$P = \prod(3,5,6,7)$$

Which was obtained from a modified kmap.That's it.

Also this means we can just use So and D3 for implementation of P.

$$P = S_\text{0} \cdot D_\text{3}$$
